## Milestone #2 study project, an homage to Breaking Bad!

[Visit the site on GitHub.io - breakingBadMe](https://michaeldijk.github.io/breakingbadme/)

This is a website created as a homage to a series, that is dear to my heart, I wanted to create a fan-site, covering what I've learned so far in my studies, and, also, making it interactive for the visitors, with JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

The site is created with a Mobile first approach, but, works great on larger viewwindows / computers as well. It covers interactivity from the front-page to the Trivia page, to the Characters page.

The site had to be well visible on all devices, have an interactive and intuitive design, and, look pleasing to the eye.

It has two different views, lightmode and darkmode, see mockups below:
    * Darkmode:
